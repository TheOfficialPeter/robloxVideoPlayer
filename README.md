# Video Player Framework

Almost done with the main concept thereafter I will make the framework more user-friendly and optimize the code.

The framework aims to povide your roblox game with a utility to watch any video on the internet inside of your roblox game using external screen capture and a webserver.

I do realise that the TOS won't allow such frameworks, but that is why I am letting you know that I am sharing this for educational purposes only, which does not include any malicious intent. Enjoy.
